# Data-Analysis-and-overview-Pipeline
In this, I have taken a dataset from Uber and built aÂ  data model in fact and dimension format. I have written the transformation code in Python. The code was deployed on compute instance on google cloud where I installed MAZE(data pipeline tool) and then I loaded the data on BigQuery and created the final dashboard on Lookerstudio.
